# Conveyer-Belt-HSV-Crack-Detection-Raspberry-Pi-BASED
This project uses OpenCV to detect bottles and cracks using HSV color saturation. In case of crack the bottle will be discarded. Raspberry Pi 3B is used as a microcomputer for performing Image Processing applications in this project.

I have also written a script named as Realtime.py 

The function of the script is to check the bottle and crack in real time. For managing the performance we have connected Arduino for motor control and Pi provides serial input to Arduino (for perform actions accordingly)
